# Photo-Frame

This is a WiFi-enabled e-paper photo frame project that allows users to set their own pictures and receive pictures remotely. 

The current v1 in development is using an esp32 and a black & white display. v2 later next month will use a raspberry pi and a 7-color display

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, you'll need any of the components described in the above sections. You'll also need to set up a Supabase account for storage and authentication.

Once you have everything set up, you can clone the repo and start exploring the code in the esp32, pi-zero, and web folders. You'll need to set up the necessary dependencies and configurations for each component of the project.

## Contributing
I welcome contributions to the project and encourage you to fork the repo and create pull requests for any improvements or bug fixes. Please make sure to follow the code structure in the different folders, and document any changes you make.
