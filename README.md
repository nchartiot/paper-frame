# Paper Frame
ðŸš§ Under Active Development ðŸš§

This is a WiFi-enabled e-paper photo frame project that allows users to set their own pictures and receive pictures remotely. 
It is currently in development using a raspberry pi zero and a 7-color display.

## Components
- Raspberry pi zero (wherever you can find it honestly)
- [7.3 inch color display](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004989413837.html)
- 3D case model - 3D printed, model coming soon

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, you'll need any of the components described in the above sections. You'll also need to set up a Supabase account for storage and authentication.

Once you have everything set up, you can clone the repo and start exploring the code in the raspberry and web folders. You'll need to set up the necessary dependencies and configurations for each component of the project.

## Contributing
I welcome contributions to the project and encourage you to fork the repo and create pull requests for any improvements or bug fixes. Please make sure to follow the code structure in the different folders, and document any changes you make.
